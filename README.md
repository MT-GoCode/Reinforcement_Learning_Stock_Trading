# Reinforcement Learning Agent to Choose Optimal Technical Trading Strategies For Stocks
Minh Trinh

Autonomous stock trading commonly uses trading bots - computer programs implementing specific trading strategies based on signals from stock price and volume movements. Which bot can maximize profits? For a particular stock, a certain bot may outperform others on one day, under a particular market condition, but underperform on other days --  there is no all-time winner. Alternating bots daily may yield optimal results. However, selecting the right bot each day isnâ€™t a simple task.

I created an AI system to help retail traders with the bot selection process.  For a given stock, it takes in a set of data representing daily stock market conditions and selects one optimal bot from a pool of different bots for each trading day. The bots selected by the AI System achieved a greater total profit than any individual bot over the same multi-day trading periods and a Sharpe Ratio above 1, satisfying my design goals.
